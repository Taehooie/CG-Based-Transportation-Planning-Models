# CG-Based-Transportation-Planning-Models
This project aims to reformulate the transportation planning models through computational graph (CG) programming languages and establish new modeling structures as well. In this section, we have three sub-branches, and each branch indicates as follows:

1. [Travel demand choice models](https://github.com/Taehooie/CGChoiceModel.git)
2. [Transportation network models](https://github.com/Taehooie/CGNetworkModel.git)
3. [Integration of travel demand and supply models](https://github.com/Taehooie/CGEquilibrium.git)
